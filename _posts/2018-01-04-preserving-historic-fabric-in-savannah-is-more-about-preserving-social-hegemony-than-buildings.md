*Let's talk about the most sacrosanct thing for most Savannahians: 'historic fabric.'*

In Savannah's planning and zoning decisions, concern for 'historic fabric' almost always stymies new projects from coming into fruition. But what too many Savannahians fail to realize is that the entire trope of 'historic fabric' extends far deeper into the resident psyche than simply a concern for preserving the city's grand old buildings and homes.

The fear that new development or outside investment will tarnish the city's 'historic fabric' is, on a more visceral level, a fear of progress, of change, and of improvement of quality of life for residents living in the margins of our community––all in the name of protecting the status quo.
