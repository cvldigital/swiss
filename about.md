This blog documents my research into the [civic-tech](http://www.govtech.com/civic/What-is-Civic-Tech.html) movement as a social, economic and political process, not an end-product.

### Core Findings:

* Civic-technology is a form of entrepreneurship, whether it has a business component or not. It disrupts economic sectors. It seeks to elicit change.&nbsp;
  * The end goal of most civic-technology groups is typically summarized as `civic engagement` or `rebuilding how society works.`
  * &nbsp;
* `Civic` doesn't always involve government; anything that builds closer, more democratic societies can be `civic`. Tinder as civic technology.
* Flexible styles that can be reused for customization without adding additional CSS.
* Simple styling for code snippets (if you want something with syntax highlighting, checkout â€¦.)
* Dynamically generated navigation links. See docs below for adding pages with specific post category for-loops.
